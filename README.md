# icodex

Isolated bash wrapper for the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli),
built following the `iclaude` example. It keeps Codex fully contained inside the project:
a pinned static `codex` binary, **per-project** state, a **safe-by-default** filesystem
sandbox, and optional proxy routing — so Codex never touches your home directory or other
projects unless you ask it to.

## How isolation works

icodex keeps Codex state in two layers:

- **Shared store** — `.codex-isolated/` holds the expensive, stable assets shared by every
  project: the pinned `codex` binary, `uv`, the vendored Superpowers plugin cache, the
  shared `auth.json`, and the tracked `config.toml` template.
- **Per-project home** — each project you launch from gets its own `CODEX_HOME` under
  `.codex-homes/<project>-<hash>/`. It symlinks the shared `plugins` and `auth.json`, copies
  the `config.toml` template once, and keeps that project's sessions, logs, and sqlite
  separate. The home is keyed by the project's git root (or working directory), so two repos
  never share session state — but they do share one login and one binary.

`.codex-homes/` is runtime state and is git-ignored.

## Setup

1. **Install the binary** (once per clone):

       ./icodex.sh --install

   Fetches the pinned `codex` binary (version + sha256 from `.codex-lockfile.json`) into
   `.codex-isolated/bin/`, and creates an `icodex` symlink in `~/.local/bin` (override with
   `ICODEX_LINK_DIR`). Put that directory on your `PATH` to run `icodex` from anywhere. An
   existing non-symlink file at the link path is never overwritten.

2. **Authenticate** (pick one):

   - Run `codex login` — writes `.codex-isolated/auth.json` (git-ignored, shared across all
     projects), or
   - Set `ICODEX_API_KEY=sk-...` in `.codex_config` (see [Configuration variables](#configuration-variables)), or
   - Export `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell — an ambient key always wins.

3. **Run** from any project directory:

       icodex                      # launch Codex, isolated to the current project
       icodex -- exec "..."        # everything after -- is forwarded to codex verbatim

## Commands

    ./icodex.sh                 # launch codex in the isolated environment (default)
    icodex                      # same, once ~/.local/bin is on PATH
    ./icodex.sh --full-access   # launch with the filesystem sandbox fully open (warns)
    ./icodex.sh --proxy http://p:8080 -- exec "..."   # route via proxy, forward args to codex
    ./icodex.sh --no-proxy      # skip the proxy for this run
    ./icodex.sh --install       # fetch the pinned binary + create the icodex symlink
    ./icodex.sh --update        # update + re-pin the codex binary only
    ./icodex.sh --clear         # remove the saved config file (.codex_config)
    ./icodex.sh --version       # icodex + codex versions
    ./icodex.sh --help          # full flag list

Anything after the first non-flag argument (or after `--`) is passed straight to `codex`.
On `--install`/`--update` the `icodex` symlink is created in `ICODEX_LINK_DIR`. `--install`
and `--update` fetch only the Codex binary; `--update` prints each network/install stage
with curl's download progress bar. The Superpowers plugin and skills ship through git and
are updated only by maintainer scripts.

## Configuration variables

Settings you want on every run live in a `.codex_config` file at the project root
(git-ignored, `chmod 600`). Start from the template:

    cp .codex_config.example .codex_config
    chmod 600 .codex_config

The file holds plain `KEY=value` lines. **Only `ICODEX_`-prefixed keys (plus
`CODEX_UV_BIN` / `UV_BIN`) are honored**, and the file is parsed — never sourced — so values
can't execute code. Precedence is **built-in defaults < `.codex_config` < command-line
flags**. Every variable below can also be set as an ordinary environment variable.

| Variable | Effect | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `ICODEX_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key → exported as `OPENAI_API_KEY` (secret; an ambient `OPENAI_API_KEY` wins) | — |
| `ICODEX_SANDBOX` | Filesystem sandbox: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, or `danger-full-access` | `workspace-write` |
| `ICODEX_PROXY` | Proxy URL, exported as `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` for codex | — |
| `ICODEX_NO_PROXY` | Comma-separated host bypass list, exported as `NO_PROXY` (e.g. `localhost,127.0.0.1,github.com`) | — |
| `ICODEX_REPO` | GitHub repo the codex binary is fetched from | `openai/codex` |
| `ICODEX_LINK_DIR` | Directory for the `icodex` symlink (leading `~/` is expanded) | `~/.local/bin` |
| `ICODEX_UNAME_S` / `ICODEX_UNAME_M` | Force the release-asset platform instead of auto-detecting via `uname` | auto |
| `CODEX_UV_BIN` / `UV_BIN` | Explicit path to `uv` (mapped to `UV_BIN`); persisted on `--install` | auto |

`ICODEX_NO_PROXY` is a bypass list (standard `NO_PROXY` semantics), **not** a disable switch
— to skip the proxy for a single run use the `--no-proxy` flag. `./icodex.sh --proxy <url>`
writes `ICODEX_PROXY` into `.codex_config` (preserving other keys); `./icodex.sh --clear`
removes the file.

> `ICODEX_*` keys reserved for the iwiki plugin (e.g. `ICODEX_IWIKI_*`) are intentionally
> ignored by the wrapper config.

## Sandbox and trust

icodex is **safe by default**: every run writes `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` into the
project's `CODEX_HOME` config, so Codex may read and write inside the workspace but not the
wider filesystem. You raise or lower the sandbox three ways, lowest to highest precedence:

1. **Default** — `workspace-write`.
2. **`ICODEX_SANDBOX`** — set `read-only`, `workspace-write`, or `danger-full-access` in
   `.codex_config` or the environment. An invalid value is rejected with an error.
3. **`--full-access` flag** — forces `danger-full-access` for that single run.

`danger-full-access` grants full filesystem access; icodex always prints a warning to stderr
when it is active. icodex also **auto-trusts** the launched project in its per-project config,
so Codex does not re-prompt for trust on every run. icodex never changes `approval_policy`
(when Codex asks before running commands) — that stays yours to set in `config.toml`.

## What lives in git

Only the **codex binary** is fetched on demand (pinned by version + sha256 in the committed
`.codex-lockfile.json`); everything else ships with the repo, so a clone is ready to use
offline once the binary is present:

- **Committed** — the curated Codex config template under `.codex-isolated/`: `AGENTS.md`,
  `AGENTS.override.md`, **`config.toml`**, `rules/default.rules`, and the pre-installed
  **Superpowers plugin** — its skills (`.codex-isolated/skills/`, excluding codex-managed
  `.system/`) and its plugin cache (`.codex-isolated/plugins/cache/*/superpowers/…`). A clone
  has the full skills framework with **no plugin install** — only the binary is fetched on
  `--install`.
- **Git-ignored** — the downloaded binary (`.codex-isolated/bin/`), secrets
  (`.codex-isolated/auth.json`, `.codex_config`), and all per-project runtime state under
  `.codex-homes/` (sessions, logs, `*.sqlite`).

The `.codex-isolated/` ignore rule is a whitelist: everything is ignored except the committed
files above, so secrets and runtime churn can never be committed by accident.

> **Existing users with a custom `config.toml`:** the base `config.toml` is tracked and acts
> as a **template** — it is copied into each per-project `CODEX_HOME` on first launch. Keep
> secrets in `.codex_config` or `auth.json`, never in `config.toml`.

## Codex config quick guide

icodex uses two config files:

- `.codex_config` — local wrapper settings: API key, sandbox, proxy, install repo, symlink
  path. This file is git-ignored and is the right place for secrets.
- `.codex-isolated/config.toml` — the **template** for Codex runtime settings: model, sandbox,
  approvals, permissions, plugins, projects, and UI. It is copied into each project's
  `CODEX_HOME` (`.codex-homes/<id>/config.toml`) on first launch; later runs only re-manage
  `sandbox_mode` and project trust there and never clobber your edits to a project's copy.
  Edit the template to change defaults for *new* project homes.

Common `.codex-isolated/config.toml` keys:

| Key | Simple meaning |
|-----|----------------|
| `model` | Default model name used by Codex |
| `model_reasoning_effort` | Reasoning level, for example `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `model_provider` | Named provider to use from `[model_providers.<name>]` |
| `sandbox_mode` | Filesystem sandbox: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, or `danger-full-access` |
| `approval_policy` | When Codex asks before commands: `untrusted`, `on-request`, `never`; `on-failure` is deprecated |
| `default_permissions` | Named managed permission profile from `[permissions.<name>]` |
| `web_search` | Web search mode used by Codex |
| `bypass_hook_trust` | Allows trusted bundled hooks to run without an interactive trust prompt |
| `[marketplaces.*]` / `[plugins.*]` | Plugin marketplace paths and enabled plugins |
| `[features]` | Feature flags, for example `multi_agent = true` |
| `[projects."<path>"]` | Project trust settings (icodex auto-adds the launched project) |
| `[tui]` | Terminal UI settings such as the status line |

Useful launch safety presets:

```toml
# Safer everyday mode: write inside the workspace, ask on risk.
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
approval_policy = "on-request"
default_permissions = "dev-safe"

# Full filesystem access, but still ask on risky actions.
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "on-request"
default_permissions = "ssh-on-request"

# No sandbox and no approval prompts.
# Equivalent to: codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "never"
default_permissions = "ssh-on-request"
```

`default_permissions` is not the same as `sandbox_mode`. It selects one of the named managed
profiles below in the same TOML file, such as `dev-safe` or `ssh-on-request`. Those profiles
describe allowed files, denied secrets, network access, and SSH access. They matter most when
Codex runs with managed permissions or `workspace-write`.

> `sandbox_mode` in the template is the **starting** value for a new project home; on each run
> icodex re-applies the effective sandbox (see [Sandbox and trust](#sandbox-and-trust)) into
> that home's `config.toml`.
